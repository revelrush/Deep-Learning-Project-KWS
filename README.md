# DL_Assignment2

##Student Name - Mith Concio

This repository is to serve as my submission for assignment 2 in the deep learning elective.

##Usage:
Assuming the whole git repository is cloned in one directory, the only things that have to be run are either train.py or test.py, all the other files are only there so that these two can run properly.

##Notes:
Assumption is that libraries that were used in the pytorch tutorial are all pre-installed (torch, torchvision, PIL etc.), and other libraries to be used to download the dataset (gdown) will be installed by train.py and test.py if they are run.

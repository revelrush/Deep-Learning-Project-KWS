# DL_Assignment3

## Student Name - Mith Concio

This repository is to serve as my submission for assignment 3 in the deep learning elective.

## About the KWS Model:
The model used was the Vit Transformer architechture provided by the course handler and has the following specifications: 4 heads, a depth of 12 and has an embedding dimension of 64. The model was also implemented using pytorch lightning framework as instructed in the directions, and the dataset used to train the model was from the original KWS paper.

## Notes and Assumptions:
The libraries used in this assignment are identical with the ones used in the KWS training demo, KWS app and Vit transformer training demo, with no new libraries used. In case any of the modules are missing, the command pip install -r requirements.txt can be used to install the missing modules. 

## Usage:
Assuming the whole git repository is cloned in one directory, the only things that have to be run are either train.py or kws-infer.py, all the other files are only there so that these two can run properly.
